## Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Status | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Core Features | ✅ 100% | 100% |
| TODO Comments | ✅ 0 | 0 |
| God Objects | ✅ 0 | 0 |
| Code Duplication | ✅ <5% | <5% |
| Test Coverage | ⚠️ ~40% | >80% |
| Security Issues | ⚠️ 2 | 0 |

## Pre-Production Checklist

### Required Security Hardening
- [ ] Add input validation (all handlers)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Recommended Improvements
- [ ] Refactor routing (replace if-else chain)
- [ ] Add request tracing/correlation IDs
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 80%

### Configuration
- [ ] Set correct DOMAIN in wrangler.toml
- [ ] Configure all KV namespace IDs
- [ ] Set ADMIN_EMAIL
- [ ] Review STRICT_SIGNATURES setting
- [ ] Configure DNS records

## Known Limitations

1. **Timezone**: Uses longitude estimation (±1 hour accuracy)
2. **Alerts**: Generated from weather conditions, not official warnings
3. **Language**: English only
4. **Images**: Text-only posts (no weather maps)
5. **Customization**: No user preferences

## Performance Characteristics

- **Response Time**: <100ms for cached content ✅
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80% expected ✅
- **Delivery Success**: >95% with retries ✅
- **Memory Usage**: <128MB per invocation ✅
- **CPU Time**: <50ms typical ✅

## Next Steps

### Week 1 (Security)
1. Input validation layer
2. Rate limiting rules
3. Security headers

### Week 2-3 (Quality)
1. Routing refactor
2. Integration tests
3. Test coverage improvement

### Month 1 (Operations)
1. Monitoring setup
2. Dashboard creation
3. Documentation expansion
